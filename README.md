# NeuroStack Task Management System (TMS)

## Overview
NeuroStack is a modern web application designed to streamline user authentication and task management for individuals and teams. This project showcases a full-stack development approach, integrating a robust backend with an intuitive frontend interface. The application supports user registration, login, and a dashboard for managing tasks, making it a versatile tool for productivity.

## Project Features
- User authentication (Register and Login)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Task management dashboard
- Role-based access (User and Admin)

## Backend Development
The backend of NeuroStack is powered by a Node.js and Express server, with a MongoDB database for storing user data and tasks. It includes RESTful APIs for handling authentication, user management, and task operations. The backend is designed to be scalable and secure, with features like token-based authentication using JWT.

## Frontend Development
The frontend is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface. It features a clean design with a split layout for the authentication pages (logo on the left, form on the right) and a dashboard for task management. The UI is responsive, utilizing CSS for styling and React Router for navigation.
